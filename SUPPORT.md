# Support Cogit

## Sponsoring

Cogit is MIT-licensed and always will be. No features are gated, no upsells, no "enterprise tier."

If Cogit saves your team time or helps you coordinate AI models without paying for a platform, consider sponsoring the project. Sponsorships keep development going and help prioritize features the community needs.

→ **GitHub Sponsors:** See the Sponsors button on this repo *(coming soon)*

## Paid Support

If you want hands-on help, I offer paid setup and customization:

- **Install** (1 repo): Set up Cogit workflows, configure `cogit.yaml`, run a demo PR through CI — working in your environment, not just a template.
- **Customize policies**: Adapt quorum rules, protected paths, size thresholds, signature formats, or add custom quality gates specific to your workflow.

Contact for pricing and availability.

## How to Request Support

Open an issue titled **`install-help: <your repo or org name>`** and include:

- Your CI environment (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, other)
- What paths you want protected
- Desired quorum (how many signers)
- What problem you're trying to solve

Or reach out directly via the contact methods listed on the GitHub profile.

## Free Support

For bugs, questions, and feature requests: open a regular [GitHub issue](../../issues). The community and maintainers will help where we can.
